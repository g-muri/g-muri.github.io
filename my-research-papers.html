    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
    <p class="text-justified"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02482" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02482">Blended mathematical sensemaking in science (blended MSS)</a> involves developing a conceptual understanding of quantitative relationships 
    and the scientific meaning of equations describing phenomena. In recent work, Kaldaras & Wieman developed and provided initial validity evidence for a unified cognitive framework (the framework) 
    for blended MSS across various scientific disciplines, including Physics and Chemistry. The framework describes increasingly sophisticated ways of engaging in blended MSS as students develop an 
    equation describing the scientific phenomenon or build a deeper understanding of the known equation describing the phenomenon. Kaldaras and Wieman validated the framework for simple mathematical 
    relationships describing scientific phenomena involving multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition. In my senior thesis, I am extending the framework by Kaldaras & Wieman to include 
    mathematical relationships describing phenomena that include vectors, vector operations, and integrals. I will present initial validity evidence for my framework grounded in analysis of student 
    interviews. I use my cognitive framework to investigate whether taking vector calculus and intro electricity and magnetism (E&M) in separate contexts or courses that do not support blended MSS is 
    effective in helping students build an integrated understanding of physics phenomena involving vectors, vector operations, and integrals. The interview analysis showed evidence for the validity 
    of most of the levels of my framework for vectors, vector operations, and integrals. Interview analysis results showed no significant difference in the ability to engage in blended MSS between 
    students who took intro E&M and students who did not. This finding suggests that intro E&M does not sufficiently prepare students to engage in higher levels of blended MSS for physics phenomena 
    involving vectors, vector operations, and integrals.</p>
